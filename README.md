CSCI 127: Joy and Beauty of Data - MSU Bozeman - Fall 2021 - PYTHON

    -Program1: Program to generate flags with 3 colored stripes, and checks the flag generated against a known database of real flags using the same format.

    -Program2: Program to classify user input poker hands as a pair, two pair, three of a kind, etc.

    -Program3: Program to generate statistics on COVID data supplied in a .csv file, and then, optionally, format and save said statistics in a new file.

    -Program4: Given a list of US Presidents in a CSV, sorts and prints the presidents in order by one of 5 metrics, name, number, occupation, term length, or
               the order of the input list.

    -Program5: Version of the Cracker Barrel peg game with variavble size, played through the command line.



CSCI 145A: Intro to Web Design - MSU Bozeman - Fall 2021 - HTML & CSS

    -FINAL DRAFT^: Website made for final project for CSCI 145A at MSU Bozeman. Website is a mock store page for an outdoor supplies company.

CSC 115: Test Driven Software Development - SDSMT - Spring 2022 - C++

    -thpe1: Program to check the validity of credit card numbers based on length, contents, and Luhn's algorithm, and then identifies credit card type based on paramaters given by the assignment.

    -thpe2: Collection of math functions, including roots, log, factorial, and trig functions (making use of Taylor series), and functions to sort and search through arrays.

    -thpe3: Program to classify a given set of poker hands, and give statistics about the set of hands provided. Has options for manual input of hands or random generation of any number of legal poker hands.

    -thpef: Program to mimic a bank system. Stores accounts and their balances, can make payments or add to debt. Reads from and prints to files for continuous storage of accounts and their data.
    


CSC 215: Programming Techniques - SDSMT - Fall 2022 - C++

    -thpe01: Program to read .ppm images in either an ascii or a binary format, perform one of a list of possible changes (brighten, negate, sharpen, smooth, grayscale, contrast), and write the image back out to a 
    .ppm file (or .pgm in the case of the grayscale or contrast operations) in either an ascii or a binary format.

    -thpe02: This program will take a .txt file with specially formated instructions to create, populate, and edit a .srt file to be used as subtitles for a movie or other video. 
    This program is able to either create a .srt file to be populated or copy an existing .srt file given as a command line argument.
    The program is able to add and remove frames to and from the .srt file, print the .srt file to an output stream, change the times that each caption will be displayed between, add text to the caption to be displayed, and show the duration that any caption will be displayed.

    -thpe03: This program will take a .ppm image formated as either an ascii or binary file.
    It will read the file into an image structure containing a magic number, which indicates the format of the image data (ascii or binary, and wether or not it's grayscale), any comments that the .ppm file contains, the resolution of the image in number of rows and collumns, and three 2d arrays containing the individual RGB values for the pixels. 
    Next, based on the given pixel coordinates (row and column), and RGB value, the flood fill operation is performed at the given pixel coordinate, coloring all pixels adjascent to the input pixel that share it's color with the color that was input with the RGB value. 

    thpe04:  When running this program you have the option of supplying two decks of cards via two files, or supplying two integer seeds with which to randomly generate two decks of cards. After the two decks are read or created, a game of War is simulated with the number of rounds played and the final player hands displayed two the screen when the game concludes.


CSC 340: Software Engineering - SDSMT - Spring 2023 - C#, HTML, CSS

    -team16, StuView: .NET7 web app using an MVC architecture, developed over the course of the semester. Includes registering and signing in with 2 factor authentication through email, several different list views of the database of students, systems to track and leave comments on particular students, implementation of all CRUD functionality for list of students, ability to add an image for students, and many filtering/sorting options for student list.
    



*Note: This is not a comprehensive list of the code I wrote in college, but a collection of the projects I feel best showcase the skills I developed through these classes.
