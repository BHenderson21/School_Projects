CSCI 127: Joy and Beauty of Data - MSU Bozeman - Fall 2021 - PYTHON

    -Program1: Program to generate flags with 3 colored stripes, and checks the flag generated against a known database of real flags using the same format.

    -Program2: Program to classify user input poker hands as a pair, two pair, three of a kind, etc.

    -Program3: Program to generate statistics on COVID data supplied in a .csv file, and then, optionally, format and save said statistics in a new file.

    -Program4: Given a list of US Presidents in a CSV, sorts and prints the presidents in order by one of 5 metrics, name, number, occupation, term length, or
               the order of the input list.

    -Program5: Version of the Cracker Barrel peg game with variavble size, played through the command line.

CSC 115: Test Driven Software Development - SDSMT - Spring 2022 - C++

    -thpe1: Program to check the validity of credit card numbers based on length, contents, and Luhn's algorithm, and then identifies credit card type based on paramaters given by the assignment.

    -thpe2: Collection of math functions, including roots, log, factorial, and trig functions (making use of Taylor series), and functions to sort and search through arrays.

    -thpe3: Program to classify a given set of poker hands, and give statistics about the set of hands provided. Has options for manual input of hands or random generation of any number of legal poker hands.

    -thpef: Program to mimic a bank system. Stores accounts and their balances, can make payments or add to debt. Reads from and prints to files for continuous storage of accounts and their data.
    
CSC 215: Programming Techniques - SDSMT - Fall 2022 - C++

    -thpe01: Program to read .ppm images in either an ascii or a binary format, perform one of a list of possible changes (brighten, negate, sharpen, smooth, grayscale, contrast), and write the image back out to a 
    .ppm file (or .pgm in the case of the grayscale or contrast operations) in either an ascii or a binary format.

*Note: This is not a comprehensive list of the code I wrote in college, but a collection of the projects I feel best showcase the skills I developed through these classes.
